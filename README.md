# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This website was created to aid bootcamp students as they study their assigned prework. I found it important to create this project because, not only did it allow me to practice writing in code languages like JavaScript, CSS and HTML, but it also allows me to catalogue the information I've learned in an applicable way. The website also features functionality with Chrome DevTools, in which study suggestions will appear randomly in the console log.

This website can be used to study different topics covered in the course prework for code bootcamp. Users of the website are able to open Chrome DevTools and navigate to the console screen, where a list of all prework topics and a suggestion for which to study first will appear.
